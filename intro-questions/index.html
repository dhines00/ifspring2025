        <h1>Dion's Super Dope Intro</h1>

        <h2>Ciao a tutti!</h2>

       <ol>
        <li>My name is Dion Hines, and I'm a sophomore double majoring in Communication Design and English Literature!</li>
        <li>I was "classically trained," so you could say, in visual arts from fourth grade until my senior year of high school, so I am not STEM-oriented whatsoever. I'm taking this course because of a degree requirement, but I'm excited nonetheless!</li>
        <li>I don't have experience in coding at all. I'm kinda just vibing</li>
        <li>I know it sounds like a cop-out by I'm fine with learning any basic HTML and CSS programming. This assignment alone was something for me to brag about</li>
        <li>I expect brevity to be more important when designing for a screen.</li>
        <li><a href="https://letterformarchive.org/">The Letterform Archive</a>: Not only is the art included in the artciles beautiful, but the simple, universal layout doesn't overwhelm the viewer.</li>
        <li><a href="https://samfoxschool.washu.edu/">Sam Fox School Website</a>: Simply put, I find Sam Fox's website easy to navigate. The word and image balance is nice.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/?Camp=SEM*EC*US*EN*16517868952*brand*goog*pros*20220307*&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAhbi8BhDIARIsAJLOlue2sT64L7ZqJnqapmqZn1ane2U9-MuyMrYKpTWvy8C9qwPwox99F1YaAvUzEALw_wcB">Levi's</a>: The layout is very clean, in my opinion, though it involves a lot of scrolling.</li>
