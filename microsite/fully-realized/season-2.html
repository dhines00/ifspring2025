        <h1>Season 2</h1>
        <p>The second season received universal acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an approval rating of 100% with an average rating of 8.7/10 based on 22 critics. The website's critics consensus is, "Bojack Horseman truly comes into its own during season two, maturing into an ambitious comedy that sensitively blends wackiness with dark, nuanced drama." On Metacritic, the season has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 7 critics. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox wrote that the show had "found its footing beautifully in season two, earning the title of not just the streaming service's best show, but of one of television's best shows". Liz Shannon Miller of IndieWire gave the series a grade of "A−", praising the depth of the show's storyline, the voice cast and the superior comedy in comparison to the first season. Vikram Murthi of The A.V. Club also gave the series an "A−", commenting that "for the most part, it's an entirely unique, funny, and melancholic exploration into the heart and mind of someone struggling to put his life back on track after a series of dark turns".</p>
        <p>Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine awarded the series four-and-a-half stars out of five, commenting that "BoJack Horseman's second season is an even more confident blend of the various tones it experimentally donned last year, as it's simultaneously melancholic, angry, goofy, playful, and often uproariously funny in a distinctively ineffable what-the-fuck fashion". Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B rating, stating it was "one of TV's best meta-skewers of Hollywood".</p>

            <p>Is a burrowing owl who is BoJack's girlfriend in season 2. She meets BoJack after reviving from a thirty-year coma. BoJack dates her because she has no idea who he is amidst his post-novel fame. She is a television executive for the MBN network and produces the gameshow Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities: What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?? Let's Find Out!. Wanda and BoJack break up due BoJack's bitterness and negativity. She was promoted immediately after coming out of the coma as "no one else had worked there that long." She eventually changes networks and is replaced by Pinky Penguin as executive. It is revealed through a sight-gag in the series finale that she eventually went through a second coma.</p>

            <h1>Charlotte Carson</h1>
            <p>Is a deer who was Herb Kazzaz's old girlfriend with whom BoJack was once in love. During a drug and alcohol induced stupor in "Downer Ending", BoJack imagines an alternate life where instead of becoming a television star he moves to Maine with Charlotte. In this fantasy, the couple get married, have a daughter named Harper, and lead a quiet rustic lifestyle. In "Still Broken", Charlotte attended Herb Kazzaz's funeral. In a discussion with BoJack, she mentioned that she visited Herb and read the part in BoJack's book on how he and Herb fought over a telescope. She tells him she only lived in Maine for a month and later moved to Tesuque, New Mexico.</p>
