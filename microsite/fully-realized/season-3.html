        <h1>Season 3</h1>
        <p>The third season received near-universal acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season has an approval rating of 100% with average rating of 9.1 based on 31 reviews. The website's critics consensus is, "Skillfully puncturing the idea of celebrity and our culture's bizarre obsession with it, BoJack Horseman's third season continues its streak as one of the funniest and most heartbreaking shows on television." On Metacritic, the season received a score of 89 out of 100, based on 12 reviews. Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter lauded the season, commenting that the show "evolved from frothy talking-animal Hollywood satire to character-rich treatise on depression in its first season, deepened and darkened into one of TV's best shows in its second season and gallops into its third season with a profound confidence". Entertainment Weekly gave the series an A rating, stating the season is "more digressive than the show's first two years, and much more open-ended, sending core characters in different directions" and that it "builds to one of the funniest, weirdest, and most profound moments ever seen in a television show".</p>
        <p>The A.V. Club awarded the series an A−, commenting that "Netflix has taken it upon itself to add BoJack to the line of TV's famous antiheroes" and praising the show for improving with each series. Chris Cabin of Collider gave the show four out of five stars, stating "BoJack Horseman ends up becoming a thrilling, rueful study of the psychological games and uniquely vain, notably capitalistic decision-making that powers the entertainment industry". They went on to praise the show's humor; "through its venomous jokes and unrelenting, uproarious gags, the series also recognizes how charming, joyful, and galvanizing entertainment for entertainment sake can be, no matter how stupid or silly it may seem".</p>

            <h1>Crackerjack Sugarman</h1>
            <p>Beatrice Horseman's older brother, BoJack's uncle, and the eldest son of Joseph and Honey Sugarman, who died in World War II when Beatrice was very young. He died in December 1944. He later appears at the end of the series as one of the many deceased people BoJack sees in his hallucination with whom he ecstatically meets while in his hallucination following his near-death experience. During the theatrical show scene in BoJack's hallucination, he plays the trumpet for Beatrice while she does an acrobatic routine.</p>

            <p>Was Beatrice's father and BoJack's maternal grandfather, the owner of the Sugarman Sugar corporation. Emotionally distant, he frequently spouted his backward views about women, making Beatrice feel insecure and inadequate (for which she compensates with cruelty as an adult).</p>
