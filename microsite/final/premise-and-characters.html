        <h1>Premise</h1>
        <p>The series is set in an alternate world where humans and anthropomorphic animals live side by side, taking place mostly in Hollywood (renamed to "Hollywoo" early in the first season after the D is stolen from the sign). BoJack Horseman is the washed-up star of the fictional 1990s sitcom Horsin' Around, which centered around a young bachelor horse trying to raise three human children who had been orphaned.</p>
        <p>Now living in relative obscurity in his Hollywood Hills mansion, BoJack plans a monumental comeback to celebrity relevance with a tell-all autobiography to be written by ghostwriter Diane Nguyen. At the same time, he deals with his addiction to alcohol and other drugs, and the resulting recklessness. BoJack also has to contend with the demands of his agent and former girlfriend Princess Carolyn, the misguided antics of his freeloading roommate Todd Chavez, and his former rival Mr. Peanutbutter.</p>
