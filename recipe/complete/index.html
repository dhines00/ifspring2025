            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>For the Grits (Prep Time - 30 minutes):</h3>
            <img src="images/grits.jpg" alt="Grits">
            <ol>
                <li>In a large saucepan, bring the water, milk/half and half, and salt to a boil over medium-high heat. When boiling, gradually whisk in the grits, a little at a time to prevent clumping, stirring well until blended. Then reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Let the grits slowly cook and simmer, going back to the pot often to whisk the grits to prevent lumps, until tender- about 30 minutes. During the cooking process, add a splash of water to the grits if you see that they’re looking too stiff. No one wants stiff grits!</li>
                <li>Remove the grits from the heat. Stir in the butter and ½ cup of cheddar cheese until thoroughly combined. Give the grits a taste, if you like your grits extra cheesy, sprinkle in ½ cup more shredded cheddar cheese. Season with more salt, if desired. Keep the grits warm on the lowest setting while you make the creamy shrimp gravy. Note: If the grits start to lock up and get stiff, simply add a splash of water or chicken broth to help loosen. You want the grits to have a thick yet creamy texture.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For the Shrimp (Prep Time - about 25 minutes)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large skillet, melt two tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Working in batches, add the shrimp in a single layer and sauté for 1-2 minutes until opaque and slightly pink in color. Flip the shrimp onto the other side and continue cooking for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Then use a slotted utensil to transfer the sautéed shrimp to a clean plate and set aside. Repeat the process until all shrimp is sautéed and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the sausage/chorizo into the skillet and cook just until golden brown and slightly crisp on both sides, about 2-3 minutes. Then use a slotted utensil to transfer the andouille to the plate with the shrimp.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining two tablespoons of butter into the skillet. When hot, add the diced bell pepper, onion, and celery. Sauté the veggies until tender and golden brown, about 4-5 minutes. Then stir in the garlic and continue cooking until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle in the flour and stir with the veggie mixture, tossing well to cook out the flour, about 1 minute. </li>
                <li>Gradually stir in the chicken broth/stock, stirring well to fully combine. Let broth/stock simmer for 1 minute until all flour has dissipated.</li>
                <li>Then stir in the heavy cream and cook, stirring, until the gravy is smooth and thick, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the sautéed shrimp and andouille back into the skillet along with any residual juices, and toss well to coat in the gravy. Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes for the flavors to meld. Stir in the chopped parsley. Add additional seasoning as necessary.</li>
                <li>Divide the warm grits evenly among serving bowls. Top grits with an even amount of the shrimp gravy. Garnish the creamy lowcountry shrimp and grits with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
