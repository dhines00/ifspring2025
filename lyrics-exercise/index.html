    <h3>(Verse 1)</h3>
    <p>Why, oh, why? (Why?)</p>
    <p>Gave you several years of my life</p>
    <p>And it just ain't right</p>
    <p>What's your perception of love</p>
    <p>Now, how many times did we say it was over</p>
    <p>And how many times did we not leave</p>
    <p>There's no sense in this love hangover</p>
    <p>Please come back to me</p>
    <br>
    <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
    <p>'Cause I can't forget your ways</p>
    <p>I still remember our first kiss, oh</p>
    <p>I'm nervous and tremblin'</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Wonderin' where you've been</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>I can't cope with this</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>You're the one to help me quit</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>In the midnight hour</p>
    <p>Late in the midnight hour</p>
    <br>
    <h3>(Verse 2)</h3>
    <p>I see the edge of your face, ooh ooh ooh</p>
    <p>And it makes it hard for me to breathe</p>
    <p>What can I do to change your decision</p>
    <p>Please work with me (Me, me), yeah</p>
    <p>Sometimes my eyes won't close from weepin'</p>
    <p>And sometimes I can't wake up from sleepin' (Why?)</p>
    <p>'Cause you keep callin' me, keep callin' me in my dreams</p>
    <br>
    <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
    <p>I can't forget your ways</p>
    <p>I still remember our first kiss, ooh ooh</p>
    <p>I'm nervous and tremblin'</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Oh, wonderin' where you've been</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Ooh ooh, I can't cope with this</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Ooh, you're the one to help me quit</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Ooh ooh ooh</p>
    <br>
    <h3>(Bridge)</h3>
    <p>Newport, Winston Salem's, Marlboro Lights</p>
    <p>Don't matter what the kind</p>
    <p>'Cause you got me smoking out on you</p>
    <p>Got me puffin' 'bout a pack a night (Pack a night)</p>
    <p>And I know it ain't healthy, yeah yeah yeah</p>
    <br>
    <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
    <p>Nervous and tremblin'</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>Oh oh oh, wonderin' where you've been</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night (At night)</p>
    <p>I can't cope with this</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night (At night)</p>
    <p>You're the one to help me quit</p>
    <p>Ooh ooh ooh, nervous and tremblin'</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
    <p>(I'm nervous and tremblin')</p>
    <p>Wonderin' where you've been</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night (At night)</p>
    <p>I can't cope with this</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night (Smokin')</p>
    <p>You're the one to help me quit</p>
    <p>Smoking cigarettes at night</p>
